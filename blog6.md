### Question: How to create a better dining experience for single eater?
#### Poster
Based on the observation last week, I found the warm color in Ichiran improved the solo dinning experience. In order to visualize that, I made a poster sized illustration to abstract the color of everything on table. Obejects are simplized and geometrized, only the colors and color ratios remained.
