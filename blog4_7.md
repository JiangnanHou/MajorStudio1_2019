Eating is an intimate physical activity. Food touch your body, go into your body, and become a part of your body eventually. Especially when you eat alone, without all the distractions, eating could also be reflective. There will be a moment when you are facing your food, feeling a connection, and turn back to reflect on your true self.

Prototype 4 is a conceptual video. If your food can talk, what would it say? What would its personality be like? How would you feel when the emotional connection is built face to face, heart to heart? 

In Bootcamp, I started a topic of building empathy between human and food. I explored by filming people eating tomatoes, and told them to imagine if the tomato was someone they loved. This prototype could be seen as an extension of that question, but it's important to note that eating alone, focusing on eating/food itself made it possible to be reflective and thought provoking.
