Microwave oven is essential to single eaters. It's fast, it's convenient, and sometimes could be dangerous. Borrowed the name from To Kill a Mockingbird, prototype 6 showed things you shouldn't heat by a microwave oven. This viedo is filmed inside the microwave oven, from the machine's perspective. Combined with explosion and firework animations made by Unity and the angry  background music(Der HÃ¶lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen, from Magic Flute, the night queen singing about revenge), the video seemed to express the rage of the microwave oven. The ending of human trying to put herself into the oven also added the absurdity, and showed the danger for both human and microwave oven resulted from negligence.

Single people who often use microwave oven at home have always being judeged. They are critcized for being lazy, careless about quality and even pathetic. However, there are people argue back that microwave oven can also be a good tool for cooking. Plenty of online tutorial videos are showing people how to cook a proper meal using microwave oven. As for me, there is nothing wrong with a fast cooking, as long as you cook smart with care and respect for your food, your kitchen and yourself.
