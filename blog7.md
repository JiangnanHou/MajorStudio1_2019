## 10/20/19 - Midterm Reflection
To squeeze research question, observations, three precedents, visualization and principles all in ten minutes was not easy. I'm glad I made it mostly successful. Thanks to my past experience of being a project manager which required me to make proposals and presentations on a daily basis, I didn't struggle too much on the whole storytelling and flow. However, there are still several points I didn't explain very well which crits also asked about.

The first one is the stigma of DINING alone. I talked about the stigma of being out alone and gave evidence of how people are likely to live alone. But the problems of dining alone was kind of missed in my storytelling or simply mentioned without further explanation. As Richard asked, if you right now are eating out alone in New York, what is the problem? Indeed that was the real problem I'm gonna solve but I just missed it. After the presentation, I thought through this question again and I think my answer should be the following points:

1.The gaze of other people make one feel uncomfortable and pressured, and being alone amplify the unease;

2.The social pressure of not being with someone seen as uncommon in a public restaurant;(or a cultural pressure as Sven mentioned in the example of Italy)

3.The socializing atmosphere is not good for one who wants to enjoy some time alone.

Actually some of the answers are already in my previous blog posts. I guess the problem is how to extract the most important points of my research findings and present them to the audience. Harpreet also mentioned it in his feedback: It might be a better idea to also include other observation diagrams to make it clear that you’re in the exploration phase and how you are picking out elements one by one. 

There is also one thing I didn't consider at the phase of midterm but both crits have mentioned: technology. Richard's question "Where do you see technology here?" was quite unexpected to me at that moment. I haven't thought about technology because we are still prior to the stage of form. But as he explained further, "Imagine I live home, I don’t have a partner and I don’t live with my family, how will technology play a role in that?" this started to seem more clear and inspiring. Technology is changing the way we communicate. It gives us more opportunities to connect with the world but physically being alone, or create more tools for us to disconnect. It's definitely playing an important role when talking about how to spend our time alone. In the example of EENMAAL, tech devices are put away to help diners enjoy the pure pleasure of good food. But do we have to shut off technology for a better experience? Ichiran answered this question by creating a private cubicle. Technology is not rejected, but a safe environment is still there for a concentration of flavor. For me, I definitely want to incorporate technology in this project, and it's gonna be very interesting to see how technology play its role to connect and disconnect during the dining experience.

As Sven said, "There may be something driving you towards technology, so many ways of integrating technology in any experiment you do." And I totally agree that it’s a fascinating topic that could invite very interesting forms. It's really exciting that I'm open to so many possible forms and creative experiments. But it also gives me a lot of pressure as it's an interesting topic that many people have thought about it, so the expectations are higher for me. I think there is one thing very important that I need to keep in mind: before doing it for the mass audience, do it for myself first. First of all, this topic came from a very personal perspective of how can I enjoy my time alone? It might be the nature of society today, and I personally feel it everyday. This is more than just eating or the respect for food, it's also about the power of independency. A better solo dining experience is a celebration of independent living and the ability to take care of ourselves physically and emotionally.

Afterall, I'm really looking forward to going further in this direction and whatever terminology I'm using. In one of the readings about critical making, I really like what John Maeda said about school learning: "In doing so, I learned to truly appreciate the advantages of being a student — to get the chance to unlearn what I knew, in order to learn anew." I feel this so relatable because myself is at the same stage - going back to school and think like an active learner again. As the exploration moving on, I believe I'll have more and more understandings toward this topic and that's what drives me forward.
