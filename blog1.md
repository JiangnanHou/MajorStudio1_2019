## 08/31/19 - Research, Brainstorming and 1st Draft

### Location:
Thompkin Square Park
### Background Research:
Since its beginnings in the 19th century, Tompkins Square Park has served as a home for New Yorker’s to voice their political dissent. In 1857 and 1875 residents protested job scarcity and the poor economy. In the 1980’s and 90’s, local residents protested gentrification.

While we were walking around the park, we found some historical memorial sites as well as an honor memorial tree for the late park supervisor. All of these have made it a lovely public space for residents and vitnessed the change of the park along the history.

During the observation, we saw an "abandoned" ping-pong table also named after the late supervisor Harry Greenberg. It's nicely buildt and quite spacial but no one was actually using it. Lots of people were walking by because it's well located, but the area is quite cozy and chill since most of them were resting on the bench or walking their dogs. We decided to choose this pingpong table as the spot where the interaction is to happen.

We also liked the idea of changing the function of something and there is a lot that we could do to turn the ping-pong table into something else.

#### Behavior Mapping
We mapped the track people walking around the pingpong table and counted how many of each group of people were walking by.

### Ideation
The first idea we came up with was to simply provide a pair of paddle and a pingpong ball and let people play. Adding color on the table and even making a luminous ball could also make it eyecatching and attract people here. 

Make the pingpong table function as a pingpong table is a safe choice. But as our brainstorming and ideating going further, we came up with more interesting ideas. How about making it something totally different? There are a few art projects we remembered seeing before:

*Dinner Party, Judy Chicago*

#### Sketch
As shown in our map, there are a lot of couples, friends and students walking by. Why don't we make a table for dates in the park? The setting could be formal and romantic, but more in a fun and playful way.

We decided to add chairs around the table, place table cloth, tableware made of cupboard and paper and other items on it to make a fun and beautiful place where people can stop and interact with. As the ping-pong table itself is larger than a regular dinner table for 2, we thought it could be interesting if we made everything on it much bigger than in real life. This also could be considered a "larger than life" concept. We'll observe the interactions(sitting down? taking pics? talking?) and document it by shooting a video.
