## 08/31/19 - Research and Brainstorming

### Location:
Thompkin Square Park
### Background Research:
Since its beginnings in the 19th century, Tompkins Square Park has served as a home for New Yorker’s to voice their political dissent. In 1857 and 1875 residents protested job scarcity and the poor economy. In the 1980’s and 90’s, local residents protested gentrification.

While we walking around the park, we found some historical memorial sites as well as an honor memorial tree for the late park supervisor. All of these have made it a lovely public space for residents and vitnessed the change of the park along the history.
