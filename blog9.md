## 12/15/19 - Final output and reflection
In a small and quiet room, the participant is going to have a unique experience by interacting, listening, watching and eating alone in the room. The participant is expected to catch a feeling of comfort, and to build empathic understanding of loneliness in an emotional and sensual way.
This project aims to amplify the value of being alone, and make a statement that the honesty to face the loneliness could give us the power to eliminate the fear and ease the burden, and to discover the beauty of it.

### g. How has this prototype allowed you to engage in your goals within this program? Does this feel like a possible future direction?
This topic is linked to a broader question in psychology, philosophy and mental health. In my understanding, loneliness has many levels. There is loneliness caused mostly by unwanted isolation, which we experience all the time as we often live independently nowadays(my project this semester is mostly at this level); there is more severe loneliness that causes mental health issues like depression and anxiety; there is also hermits who go self-banished into their rural retreats, that choose loneliness as a lifestyle, which is much to a philosophical level. By digging deeper into this topic, I could go further in psychological therapy study, (I actually have already started something onto art therapy but didn’t go on) or study about the philosophy of loneliness. I’m always fascinated by human emotions and the emotional factors that are affecting their choices of life. This is definitely a direction I'm interested in. I hope that by my artistic or design approaches, I could present the sophisticated human nature, and eventually bring hope to people.
