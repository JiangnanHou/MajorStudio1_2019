## 12/15/19 - Final output and reflection

To squeeze research question, observations, three precedents, visualization and principles all in ten minutes was not easy. I'm glad I made it mostly successful. Thanks to my past experience of being a project manager which required me to make proposals and presentations on a daily basis, I didn't struggle too much on the whole storytelling and flow. However, there are still several points I didn't explain very well which crits also asked about.

a. What are the specific questions you are attempting to answer in your prototypes?
b. What the five strengths of your project?
c. What are the five most critical issues for your project?
d. What can you do to address these issues, and to solidify the strengths?
e. What new questions do you have?
f. What questions need to be answered in order to create a proof of concept prototype?
g. How has this prototype allowed you to engage in your goals within this program? Does this feel like a possible future direction?
