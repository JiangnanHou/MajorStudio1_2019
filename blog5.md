## 10/01/19 - Research Observation
The two questions I kept are:

1.How to create a better dining experience for single eater?

2.How can negative emotions/experiences(sorrow/pain/anger/stress…) be turned into power/strength?

During the online comment section, I received a lot of valuable feedback from my class to my questions, observation methods and enriched my inventory. I looked up the links of articles and have been reading them since last Wednesday. 
### Question 1: How to create a better dining experience for single eater?
In my own experience and also mentioned a lot in the comments, it seems like solo dinning is heavily influenced by Japanese culture. Thus I chose two ramen places to observe single eater's behaviors.
#### Ramen Takumi
Location: Waverly Pl, near Washington Square Park

Time: 9:25-10:00pm

Ramen Takumi is a medium sized street corner restaurant near my apartment. The costumers are usaully NYU students and local residents. It opens to 11:00pm which attracts late night eaters.

Single eaters are seated at the bar by the window.

Most of the tables for two or four are at the center of the restaurant.

The open view was pretty nice despite sometimes there are passer-bys looking closely at you eating.

I observed the the man on my left and the girl on my right who sat at the same bar with me. I documented by the drawing below:

During my 35 minutes stay, the man has been working on his laptop and looked up and down, thinking. He already paid the bill but haven't signed so the bill was left on the table and he could stay longer there to work. The girl on the right was looking at her phone all the time while eating, and left after asking the waitress where the bathroom was at 9:34pm. As a single eater, I felt more pressured when the waitress checked on me asking if I was ready to order or finished eating without a natural conversation going on with compainies. After the girl and I left, the man stood up, but not leaving. He kept working on his laptop at a position of one feet stepping on the stool, the other feet on the ground, body leaning on the wall beside him. I guess he felt a little anxious about being there alone and taking the space after eating, although there was a plenty of empty space at that time of the day.

#### Ichiran
Location: 49th St, near Time Square

Time: 11:00-11:30am

Founded in Fukuoka in 1960, Ichiran believes isolation eating helps people focus on their food. It eliminates the need for exchanging saccharine pleasantries with servers or companions. Most importantly, it helps fight the stigma of dining alone. The concept became so popular that Ichiran grew to almost 60 restaurants today. It helped popularize other solo dining experiences, such as conveyor belt sushi and counter cafes.

Ichiran is so popular that there is usually an hour waiting for a seat. I went there at the opening time in the morning so I could be seated immdiately.

There is a map in the waiting area indicating the vacancy right now. We can also tell by the floor plan that there are no tables for two or more people but only bar seats. There are three separate dinning sections behind these red curtains.

Each person is seated in a booth and isolated by tall dividers on both sides.

A survey sheet for your dinning experience and short questions about where you're from, how did you get here and how did you know Ichiran.

A hook under your table to hang your stuff on. There are also hooks on the wall at your back.

These dividers are acutaully foldable in case there are parties more than one.

For example, for this family, they folded the divider to make it a triple sized booth.

![img](img/ichiopen.jpg)
When you're first seated, you have an open view in front of your booth. It's a small rectangular window so all you can see is a waiter's arms. They hand in the menu and give you a brief introduction of how to use everything. 

![img](img/ichipeak.jpg)
The waiters work in the middle of two sections so they can walk back and forth to serve both sides. 

![img](img/ichiclose.jpg)
Once you finished order, a Japanese style bamboo curtain dropped down to separate you from the waiters. There is a call button on your table so you can call them whenever you have any needs.

Interesting detail: they even have an instruction for how to peel an egg quickly.

When they are serving, all you see is the hands.

After eating, you just need to take this payment plate to the cashier and pay there.

The observation in Ichiran is mostly based on myself as a single eater here, since it's designed to have everyone isolated in their own booth. 
I must say this was a comfortable and delightful dinning experience as a single eater. The design is based on the core concept "isolation", but opposite to loneliness: the warm lighting, the traditional Japanese style wooden furniture together with the red curtain halfly covered the entrance of the section, created a safe environment where no one is judging or peeking on you.  Everything was done quickly, the food was served in 8 minutes and I finished the whole process of eating and paying in 20 minutes. The amazing part was I didn't feel rushed or pressured to eat fast, but finished everything in a comfortable pace. I would say that the well organized process and clear instructions helped, but most importantly, you're not under the gaze of anyone, the waiters, the other customers eating or people who are waiting. 

There was another interesting and refreshing finding of this observation. Despite of the interior design, I couldn't help but noticed that the sound inside the dinning area was playing an important role to the atmosphere. Customers weren't actually talking to each other, but waiters are constantly talking to incoming costumers and to each other about what's happening. They're all people who were trained to talk politely and delightfully, so the room is filled with laughter and cheerful chatters. Also the soothing background music and crisp clinking of the plates and cups made a joyful festival atmosphere, which kind of lead you to a Japanese movie scene. The happening surroundings give single eaters not only a lively mood, but also a home-like feeling of not being alone. 

I recorded the ambience for 6 minutes: [Click here to listen.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iZGPgyjLjTLkG0JflOpcgDDVoXWYHhGq/view?usp=sharing)

I think sound could be the direction of my next step because the impact of sound is often ignored when evaluating dinning experience. This could also be the unique point of my perspective after the observation.

### Question 2: How can negative emotions/experiences (sorrow/pain/anger/stress…) be turned into power/strength?
I've been reading articles and studies about negative feelings and creativity, and also reading peoms, paintings and other art works created by people who were suffering mental diseases or traumatized. Among which, I was pretty amazed by Kim Noble, an artist and author who has Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). DID is a creative way to cope with unbearable pain. The main personality splits into several parts each having an amnesic barrier between them. In and out of hospital from the age of 14, with no formal art training, Kim and her alters became interested in painting in 2004 after spending a short time with an art therapist. The resulting 13 artists each have their own distinctive style, colour and themes that they work with. Many are unaware they share a body with other artists.

Kim and her alters' paintings.

I'm always curious about art therapy. Seeing the Kim's amazing talent discovered by her art therapist, I was more inspired to dig into the field of art therapy. Thus I visited the website fo American Art Therapy Association, an official website where you can find almost everything about art therapy in America. I learned a lot about how to qualify as an art therapist and some master programs in New York, and then I found this tool "Art therapist locater".

![img](img/aata.png)
In this map, you can find all the qualified art therapist in America by location. If you click on the dots, you can read a brief introduction and background of the person and most importantly, the person's contact info. I decided to use this information and try to find an art therapist I could talk to. I sent emails to five art therapist in Manhattan and told them about my project and my personal interest in art therapy. I know this is a long shot but still worth trying. Finally, one of the art therapist Alison Cunningham-Goldberg, wrote back and agreed to meet me. She is the cofounder and clinical director of Linda Garcia-Rose & Associates. I'm very excited about this interview on Thursday and am preparing for the questions. To be continued...
