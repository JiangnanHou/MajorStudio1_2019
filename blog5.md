## 10/01/19 - Research Observation
The two questions I kept are:

1.How to create a better dining experience for single eater?

2.How can negative emotions/experiences(sorrow/pain/anger/stress…) be turned into power/strength?

During the online comment section, I received a lot of valuable feedback from my class to my questions, observation methods and enriched my inventory. I looked up the links of articles and have been reading them since last Wednesday. 
### Question 1: How to create a better dining experience for single eater?
In my own experience and also mentioned a lot in the comments, it seems like solo dinning is heavily influenced by Japanese culture. Thus I chose 2 Ramen places to observe single eater's behaviors.
#### Ramen Takumi
Location: Waverly Pl, near Washington Square Park

Time: 9:25-9:45pm

#### Ichiran
Location: 49th St, near Time Square

Time: 11:00-11:30am

Founded in Fukuoka in 1960, Ichiran believes isolation eating helps people focus on their food. It eliminates the need for exchanging saccharine pleasantries with servers or companions. Most importantly, it helps fight the stigma of dining alone. The concept became so popular that Ichiran grew to almost 60 restaurants today. It helped popularize other solo dining experiences, such as conveyor belt sushi and counter cafes.

Ichiran is so popular that there is usually an hour waiting for a seat. I went there at the opening time in the morning so I could be seated immdiately.

There is a map in the waiting area indicating the vacancy right now. We can also tell by the floor plan that there are no tables for two or more people but only bar seats. There are three separate dinning sections behind these red curtains.

Each person is seated in a booth and isolated by tall dividers on both sides.

A survey sheet for your dinning experience and short questions about where you're from, how did you get here and how did you know Ichiran.

A hook under your table to hang your stuff on. There are also hooks on the wall at your back.

self-service water machine, tissue and toothpicks located at the center of each section.

These dividers are acutaully foldable in case there are parties more than one.

For example, for this family, they folded the divider to make it a triple sized booth.

When you're first seated, you have an open view in front of your booth. It's a small rectangular window so all you can see is a waiter's arms. They hand in the menu and give you a brief introduction of how to use everything.

The waiters work in the middle of two sections so they can walk back and forth to serve both sides.

Once you finished order, a Japanese style bamboo curtain dropped down to separate you from the waiters. There is a call button on your table so you can call them whenever you have any needs.

Interesting detail: they even have an instruction for how to peel an egg quickly.

When they are serving, all you see is the hands.

After eating, you just need to take this payment plate to the cashier and pay there.

The observation in Ichiran is mostly based on myself as a single eater here, since it's designed to have everyone isolated in their own booth. 
I must say this was a comfortable and delightful dinning experience as a single eater. The design is based on the core concept "isolation", but opposite to loneliness: the warm lighting, the traditional Japanese style wooden furniture together with the red curtain halfly covered the entrance of the section, created a safe environment where no one is judging or peeking on you.  Everything was done quickly, the food was served in 8 minutes and I finished the whole process of eating and paying in 20 minutes. The amazing part was I didn't feel rushed or pressured to eat fast, but finished everything in a comfortable pace. I would say that the well organized process and clear instructions helped, but most importantly, you're not under the gaze of anyone, the waiters, the other customers eating or people who are waiting. 

There was another interesting and refreshing finding of this observation. Despite of the interior design, I couldn't help but noticed that the sound inside the dinning area was playing an important role to the atmosphere. Customers weren't actually talking to each other, but waiters are constantly talking to incoming costumers and to each other about what's happening. They're all people who were trained to talk politely and delightfully, so the room is filled with laughter and cheerful chatters. Also the soothing background music and crisp clinking of the plates and cups made a joyful festival atmosphere, which kind of lead you to a Japanese movie scene. I recorded the ambience for 6 minutes:

### Question 2: How can negative emotions/experiences (sorrow/pain/anger/stress…) be turned into power/strength?
