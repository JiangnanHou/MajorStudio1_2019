## 10/01/19 - Research Observation
The two questions I kept are:
1.How to create a better dining experience for single eater?
2.How can negative emotions/experiences(sorrow/pain/anger/stress…) be turned into power/strength?

During the online comment section, I received a lot of valuable feedback from my class to my questions, observation methods and enriched my inventory. I looked up the links of articles and have been reading them since last Wednesday. 
### Question 1: How to create a better dining experience for single eater?
In my own experience and also mentioned a lot in the comments, it seems like solo dinning is heavily influenced by Japanese culture. Thus I chose 2 Ramen places to observe single eater's behaviors.
#### Ramen TakumiThe first one is Ramen Takumi, located on Waverly Pl, near Washington Square Park. 

#### Ichiran
The other one, Ichiran, is better known globally. Founded in Fukuoka in 1960, Ichiran believes isolation eating helps people focus on their food. It eliminates the need for exchanging saccharine pleasantries with servers or companions. Most importantly, it helps fight the stigma of dining alone. The concept became so popular that Ichiran grew to almost 60 restaurants today. It helped popularize other solo dining experiences, such as conveyor belt sushi and counter cafes.
